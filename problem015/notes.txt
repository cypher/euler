Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, there are 6 routes
(without backtracking) to the bottom right corner.

RRDD, RDRD, RDDR, DRRD, DRDR, DDRR.

How many routes are there through a 20x20 grid?

Notes:

Uhh, I think this is just a combination! You must go down 20 times,
you must go over 20 times. How many orderings of this are there?

This is a straight-up permutation. There are 40! different ways of
arranging 40 D/R choices, but the downs will have 20! duplicates and
so will the rights. So we don't really even need a program for this
one, it's just:

40! / (20! * 20!)
