# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

# Notes:

# Ouch. This will take some research. I once built a list of all the
# primes below 4 billion; this list could then be used to exhaustively
# determine primacy of any 64-bit number in a minute on a 100Mhz
# machine. Generating that list took about 10 hours, however, and the
# Euler challenge says everything should run in under a
# minute. There's got to be a way to do prime factorization, then.
